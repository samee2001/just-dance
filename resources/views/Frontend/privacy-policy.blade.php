                            store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can
                            refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Policy.</p>

                            security measures.</p>

                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">7. Do we collect information from minors?</h2>

                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">8. What are your privacy rights?</h2>
                        <p>In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have rights that allow you greater access
                            to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account
                            at any time.</p>

                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">9. Controls for do-not-track features</h2>
                        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
                            Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not
                            to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
                            uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
                            such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
                            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
                            tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in
                            a revised version of this privacy policy.</p>
